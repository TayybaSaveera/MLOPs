# Python Notebook CLI Code Explanation

## Purpose
The provided Python script is a Command Line Interface (CLI) notebook application. It allows users to log notes with timestamps, manage locations, and store the notes in a structured manner.

## Imports
- `datetime`: For handling date and time operations.
- `os.path`: For manipulating file paths.
- `logging`: For logging notes.
- `cmd`: For creating a command-line interface.
- `yaml`: For reading and writing YAML files.
- `doko`: It seems to be a custom module for handling location-related operations.

## Constants
- `ROOT`: The root directory where the notes will be stored.
- `LANDMARK_FILE`: Path to the file containing landmark locations.
- `NOTENAME`: Name of the notes file.

## Functions
### `todaynotepath(rootpath, notename)`
- Purpose: Generates the path for today's notes file.
- Parameters:
    - `rootpath`: Root directory for storing notes.
    - `notename`: Name of the notes file.
- Returns: Path to today's notes file.

### `addcontent(content)`
- Purpose: Logs content into the notes file.
- Parameters:
    - `content`: Content to be logged.

## Class: `NoteBook`
- Purpose: Implements the CLI interface for the notebook application.
- Attributes:
    - `prompt`: Prompt for the command-line interface.
- Methods:
    - `precmd(self, line)`: Executes before processing each command.
    - `do_here(self, keyword)`: Command to manage locations.
    - `default(self, line)`: Default method to handle input.
    - `do_EOF(self, line)`: Command to handle the end of file input.
    - `postloop(self)`: Executes after the main loop ends.

## Execution
- The script creates an instance of the `NoteBook` class and starts the command loop.

## Requirements
- `doko`: Custom module for handling location operations.
- `PyYAML`: Module for reading and writing YAML files.


## Usage ##

    python nb.py

In the shell you get a prompt log.

    log>

You can start typing things that will be saved in a dated space. For example, today is 27 January 2013. All entries will be saved into 

    â€¦/2013/01/27/notes.md

Typing 

    log> Moved nb.py to its own repository at https://github.com/karlcow/notebook

will save the following message in notes.md

    2013-01-27 18:50:01,346 - Moved nb.py to its own repository at https://github.com/karlcow/notebook

### help ###

    log> help

    Documented commands (type help `<topic>`):
    ========================================
    here

    Undocumented commands:
    ======================
    EOF  help

    log> help here
    return the current location.
            If a `<keyword>` is given return the location for this key.
